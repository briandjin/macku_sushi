      <p>
        Chan’s restaurants have been highly acclaimed by both local and national outlets. His first
        concept, Kaze, was named one of the nation’s “Top 10 Sushi Spots” by Bon Appetit Magazine
        and Macku Sushi was named one of the 20 "Best Sushi Restaurants in the U.S." by Travel and
        Leisure Magazine.

        “I studied the technique of sushi making for ten years before I even called myself a chef,”
        says Chef Chan. “I wanted to create a space that encouraged guests to eat sushi the way I
        have been taught and that is where the idea of sushi with toppings came from.”
      </p>

        Formally trained in Japanese cuisine, Chef Chan has become widely recognized for his
        traditional sushi and signature sashimi and nigiri. Macku Sushi blends traditional and
        modern approaches encouraging guests to dip nigiri by hand, fish-side down.

        This style of dining essentially offers the chef the choice of what to serve you based on
